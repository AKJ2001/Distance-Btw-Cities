# Distance Btw Cities
Welcome to the **Distance between Cities** project! This interactive web application showcases the seamless integration of Google Maps API to provide users with a valuable tool for calculating distances, travel times, and visualizing routes between different cities.

**Key Features:**
- **Google Maps API Integration:** We've harnessed the power of Google Maps API to create a user-friendly interface that allows you to input your desired destination and current location.

- **Front-end Technologies:** Our project leverages a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap to craft a visually appealing and responsive design, ensuring an optimal user experience across various devices.

- **Efficient Data Processing:** JavaScript takes the center stage in fetching and processing data. It enables us to dynamically calculate distances, visualize routes, and display essential travel information.

**How It Works:**
1. **Input Locations:** Users are prompted to enter their desired destination and their current location using an intuitive interface.
   
2. **Calculate Distances:** With the Google Maps API at our disposal, we seamlessly compute the distance between the provided cities and overlay them on an interactive map for visual clarity.

3. **Visual Map Representation:** The project doesn't just provide textual data; it goes a step further by visually marking the two locations on the map, enhancing user understanding.

4. **Travel Details:** Alongside the distance, the application also supplies users with the estimated time required to cover the distance, offering a comprehensive overview of the journey.

Whether you're planning a road trip, a business visit, or simply curious about the distances between different locations, our project delivers a polished and practical solution. Experience the synergy between Google Maps API, front-end technologies, and efficient data processing in action.

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute, or use this project as a foundation for your own creative endeavors. Happy mapping!
